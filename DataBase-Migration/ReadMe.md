Modules allow for the organization and reusability of Terraform code, breaking down infrastructure into smaller components. Nested modules further organize and reuse code, creating a hierarchy of modules. The use of modules provides several benefits, including standardizing infrastructure for an organization, managing dependencies between resources, easy testing and validation of infrastructure, and managing different environments. Modules provide a powerful way to improve consistency, reliability, and security of infrastructure while making it easier to test and validate changes.

### Optimizing IT Infrastructure with AWS: A Step-by-Step Guide to Migrating a WordPress Application using the Database Migration Service (DMS)
> Maximizing Efficiency, Security, and Scalability: A Comprehensive Guide to Optimizing IT Infrastructure by Migrating a WordPress Application to AWS

As a cloud-based solution, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has become the go-to platform for businesses looking to optimize their IT infrastructure and enhance their digital capabilities. One of the many use cases for AWS is the migration of web applications, and in this project will outline the process of migrating a simple WordPress application from an on-premises environment to the AWS cloud.

The current setup of the WordPress application consists of a virtual web server, simulated using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and a self-managed MariaDB database server, also simulated through EC2. The migration process will involve transferring the architecture to an EC2 web server and utilizing Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for the managed SQL database.

This migration will bring numerous benefits to the application, including increased reliability, scalability, and security. With the help of EC2, the web server will be able to handle higher traffic loads, ensuring that the application remains available even during periods of high demand. Additionally, RDS will provide a fully managed and scalable database solution, freeing up valuable time and resources previously devoted to database management.

This project is meant to serve as a guide for businesses looking to leverage the power of AWS to optimize their IT infrastructure. By migrating a simple WordPress application from an on-premises environment to AWS, we aim to highlight the benefits and ease of the migration process, and demonstrate how businesses can take advantage of AWS to enhance their digital capabilities.

AWS offers a wide range of tools and services that can help businesses transform their IT infrastructure and stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving digital landscape. The migration process is just the first step towards a more efficient, secure, and scalable solution, and the end result will be a streamlined infrastructure that is better equipped to meet the changing demands of the business.

So, whether you're a small business just starting out or an established enterprise looking to modernize your IT infrastructure, the migration of a simple WordPress application to AWS is a great place to start. By following the steps outlined in this project, you can begin to reap the benefits of AWS and take your digital capabilities to the next level

In conclusion, migrating a web application to AWS can be a complex process, but with the right tools and expertise, it can lead to a more efficient, secure, and scalable solution. The migration of a simple WordPress application from an on-premises environment to AWS, as outlined in this article, showcases the capabilities of AWS and its potential to enhance the digital capabilities of businesses.



#### Seamless Migration of On-Prem Web Applications to Cloud EC2

> Ensuring Efficient Operation through Cloning to Cloud Infrastructure

The current project requires a robust and sophisticated architecture, thus it has been divided into two phases. The first phase involves migrating a simple WordPress web application from an on-premises environment to Amazon Web Services (AWS). The on-premises environment will be a virtual web server, which is simulated using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and a self-managed MariaDB database server running on the same EC2 instance.

The migration process will involve cloning the current setup of the on-premises EC2 webserver, including its configurations and dependencies, to a cloud-based EC2 instance. This will ensure that the application continues to run smoothly in its new cloud environment, with minimal downtime or disruption to operations. 

In the second phase of the project, the architecture will be further enhanced by utilizing separate EC2 instances for the WordPress application and RDS (MariaDB) database. This architecture will provide a higher level of security, reliability, and scalability compared to the previous version.

The migration of the on-premises WordPress EC2 and RDS managed SQL database will follow the completion of the architecture upgrade, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption to operations. This migration will bring the web application to a state-of-the-art infrastructure, providing the necessary support for growth and scalability.
