# Building a Base Infrastructure for DevOps: A Guide to Get Started

Creating a solid base infrastructure is essential for any DevOps engineer, especially in the ever-evolving world of technology and innovation. In this blog, we'll explore how to deploy the fundamental infrastructure required for a cloud provider, which can be easily adapted and repurposed as needed. 
Imagine you have a brilliant new idea or project you want to develop in the cloud. Starting from scratch every time can be time-consuming and may not be the most efficient approach. A base infrastructure provides a pre-configured environment that you can easily replicate and adapt to meet the specific needs of your projects. It simplifies the process of testing and deploying new ideas, allowing you to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure setup.
Here, we'll discuss key components of this infrastructure, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), RDS, EC2 instances across Availability Zones (AZs), a load balancer, and options for storing terraform backend (state file) in either S3 or Terraform Cloud.

## Terraform Modules - The Building Blocks

Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool that allows us to define and provision cloud infrastructure using declarative configurations. One of its most powerful features is the use of modules. Modules in Terraform allow us to encapsulate infrastructure components into reusable and shareable units, making it easier to maintain and extend our infrastructure.

## Choosing AWS as the Cloud Provider

AWS is one of the leading cloud providers globally, offering a vast array of services and resources. It's a popular choice among DevOps engineers for its scalability, reliability, and extensive documentation. When building a base infrastructure, AWS provides a robust foundation with a wide range of services that can be integrated into your projects. Its global reach also ensures that your infrastructure can be deployed wherever your users or applications are located.

## Simple Projects Made Possible

Now that we've established the importance of a base infrastructure and the power of Terraform modules in an AWS environment, let's explore some simple projects that become easily achievable when using this infrastructure:

1. **Static Website Hosting**: You can quickly deploy a static website using Amazon S3 to store your assets and CloudFront for content delivery. With Terraform, you can define the necessary resources and configurations in code.

2. **Containerized Applications**: Use AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to run containerized applications. Terraform makes it straightforward to define your cluster and services.

3. **Serverless Functions**: Build serverless applications with AWS Lambda. You can create and manage your serverless functions with Terraform, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments.

4. **Database Deployments**: Set up a database instance using Amazon RDS or Amazon DynamoDB. Define your database infrastructure as code, making it easier to maintain and scale.

By having a base infrastructure in place, you can deploy these projects with confidence, knowing that the underlying architecture is well-structured and adaptable to future innovations and technologies.

In conclusion, a well-designed base infrastructure is the cornerstone for DevOps success. Using Terraform modules in an AWS environment provides flexibility, scalability, and a foundation for continuous innovation. With a robust base infrastructure, you can focus on developing and deploying projects that matter, knowing that you have a solid framework to support your endeavors. So, let's get started and build your base infrastructure to get moving your DevOps journey forward.
