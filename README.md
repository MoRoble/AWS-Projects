# AWS-projects
### Overview

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services especially servers, data storage, networking and computing power without direct active management by the user. It is renting resources on another company's computers which is only paid for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud computing providers in the world that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service offerings.

I will be demonstrating some projects to excel my experience related working with AWS products and services, with that being said I will be using AWS CloudFormation (CFN) to simplify provisioning infrastructure and management on AWS, you can create templates for the services or application architectures you want to have on AWS CFN for 1-Click deployment method.

Hodan School will be my project scenario, it is a small town I was born and raised and the school was in town centre.
