# AWS-projects
### Overview

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services especially servers, data storage, networking and computing power without direct active management by the user. Businesses can rent these resources and pay only for what they use.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading provider of cloud services, offering a mix of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. My clients have chosen AWS based on flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions.

This repository showcases hands-on AWS projects that I have successfully implemented in the production environment while working as a Cloud Engineer and serve as a personal knowledge base and reference as I continue to grow in the field of cloud engineering. 

I have designed the best current architecture in the market today and documented configuration steps in my private note. To maintain data confidentiality, I’ve used generic names throughout the projects. *“Hodan School”* serves as a fictional organization name. Other functional names used during infrastructure provisioning are also anonymized. 

To automate and accelerate infrastructure deployment, I use:

- **Terraform** as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision, update, and manage AWS services consistently and efficiently.
- **CloudFormation 1-Click deployments** for templated, simplified provisioning of specific architectures and services.

## Project Highlights

- Real-world AWS architecture and automation examples  
- IaC using Terraform and CloudFormation  
- Projects are summarized for clarity; sensitive details are omitted  
- Builds toward a modular system that can support future integration and scaling

In the end when all these pieces of projects are put together it will result in one big system that will become reference for many Engineers in their troubleshooting and implementation process.

> *Note: “Hodan” refers to the district where I was born and raised, the name is used symbolically throughout the projects.*
