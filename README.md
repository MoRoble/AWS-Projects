# AWS-projects
### Overview

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services especially servers, data storage, networking and computing power without direct active management by the user. It is renting resources on another company's computers which is only paid for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers many services in cloud computing and it is chosen by my clients based on flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service offerings.

In my GitHub repository I will be demonstrating some projects that I have successfully implemented in the production environment and to excel my experience related working with AWS products and services to be future references for me as a junior Cloud Engineers, I have designed the best current architecture in the market today and documented configuration steps in my private note. I will put my projects with a view to brevity and clarity to show my skills towards that project, with that being said I will withhold the exact information or steps to configure to protect my customers data and use a generic name for all my projects then I have interpreted the key words. Hodan School will be my organisation name and the other key functional names will be seen during provisioning infrastructure. 

For 1-Click deployment I will deploy some infrastructure using CloudFormation 1-Click deployment to simplify provisioning infrastructure and to create templates for the services or application architectures I want to have on AWS.

In the end when all these pieces of projects are put together it will result in one big system that will become reference for many Engineers in their troubleshooting and implementation process.

Hodan is one of largest district that I was born, raised and the school was in the town centre.
