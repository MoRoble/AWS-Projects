# AWS-projects
### Overview

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services especially servers, data storage, networking and computing power without direct active management by the user. It is renting resources on another company's computers which is only paid for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer many services and it is one of the leading cloud computing providers in the world that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service offerings.

I will be demonstrating some projects that I have successfully implemented on production environment and to excel my experience related working with AWS products and services, with that being said I will withhold the exact information or steps to configure to protect my customers data for this reason I have interpret the key word. Hodan School will be my organisation name so the other key names will be seen during provisioning infrastructure. 

For 1-Click deployment I will use AWS CloudFormation (CFN) to simplify provisioning infrastructure and management on AWS as well as to create templates for the services or application architectures you want to have on AWS.

Hodan is a small town I was born and raised and the school was in the town centre.
