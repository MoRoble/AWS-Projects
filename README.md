# AWS-projects
### Overview

Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services especially servers, data storage, networking and computing power without direct active management by the user. It is renting resources on another company's computers which is only paid for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers many services in cloud computing and it is chosen by my clients based on flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service offerings.

In my GitHub repository I will be demonstrating some projects that I have successfully implemented in the production environment and to excel my experience related working with AWS products and services to be future references for junior IT Engineers, I have designed the best current architecture in the market today and documented configuration steps in my private note. I will brief my projects in this repository due to data integrity and privacy for my clients as theyâ€™re currently in an active system, with that being said I will withhold the exact information or steps to configure to protect my customers data and use a generic name for all my projects then I have interpreted the key words. Hodan School will be my organisation name and the other key functional names will be seen during provisioning infrastructure.  

For 1-Click deployment I will use AWS CloudFormation (CFN) to simplify provisioning infrastructure and management on AWS as well as to create templates for the services or application architectures you want to have on AWS.

In the end when all these pieces of projects are put together it will result in one big system that will become reference for many Engineers in their troubleshooting and implementation process.

Hodan is a small town I was born, raised and the school was in the town centre.
