## Site-to-Site VPN connection

On this project I will be collaborated with Eng. Hamdi, which I believe with her amazing talent will help me achieve this project to finish in a fruitful way. This section provides an overview of the recommended initial Site-to-Site VPN architecture and highlights several important VPN connection options. I recently implemented an AWS site-to-site VPN for Hodan School to connect their on-premise network to their newly deployed AWS account.

The requirement was network level connectivity from their on-premise network (Unifi Security Gateway) to their management VPC. Support of allowing to share file data from multiple EC2â€™s or on-prem instances simultaneously.

The setup of this was simple from an AWS perspective. With Cloud Formation we deployed a Customer Gateway (CGW) using the IP address of their on-premise firewall, created a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and then the VPN Gateway (VPN).

The on-premise configuration took a bit of research to get right but once configured correctly it worked as expected. Eng. Hamdi tasked on making configuration steps for this stage of the project. She suggested to get Unify Router for its well architected interface and setup, as we aware Unifi is one of the leading networking devices in the market currently.
